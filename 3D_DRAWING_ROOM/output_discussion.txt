You can circulate inside the room, like forward,backward,left,right rotation to the each object of the room and tha fan is start rotation by clicking the switch and stop as well.
The 3d room is designed using opengl libraries in computer graphics. All the objects are monitored from each angle like a person waling in the room and try to notice all of the objects.
Thanks.
